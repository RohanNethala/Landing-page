            <p>
              Throughout the many years of coding I have under my belt, I've
              gained a lot of real-world experience, with most of it coming from
              the internships that I've done. Whether it be sitting at home or
              being in a real cubicle for a 9-5, I've worked both remotely and
              in the corporate office as part of my coding journey, and in both
              cases, I gained valuable exposure to the tech industry and the
              real world.

                  In the summers of 2023 and 2024, I interned at Travelers
                  Insurance in Hartford CT. For both summers, it was a hybrid
                  role, and I used lots of Python and SQL. I got exposure to the
                  Agile workflow and learned a lot about the insurance industry
                  while making code for the teams I worked with a lot more
                  efficient in handling large amounts of important claims and
                  business data. I also obtained lots of exposure to the
                  corporate world, and I feel that my communication skills
                  really improved as a result of my time there.

                  This was a remote internship that I did outside of Travelers
                  in the summer of 2024, where I worked on a lot of cool things.
                  For example, I helped improve the landing page of a mentorship
                  program that has successfully helped many students land
                  software engineering clients worth over $10,000+. I also
                  Helped build a web automation, multi-browser launcher that
                  other developers can use to create their own multi browser
                  agents. Impacts users on a global scale while realistically
                  aiming to generate five figure monthly revenue. Overall, this
                  was a great experience that taught me a lot about how real
                  software engineers use Git and collaborate with their team
                  members.

                <p>
                  I also did the Headstarter fellowship, which was a 7-week
                  remote internship-like program that taught me a lot about the
                  most trending, cutting-edge AI tools. I gained valuable
                  technical interview prep from Bloomberg and Capitol One
                  assistants while also working on lots of cool projects. For
                  example, I created an AI Rate My Professor application that
                  uses trained data on professors to act like the real thing,
                  and I built a flashcard SaaS app where users can study for
                  their upcoming exams with AI-generated flashcards that they
                  can save to their account for later use.

                <p>
                  During my second semester at RPI, I decided to work part-time
                  as an Undergraduate Mentor for the introductory computer
                  science class offered at my school, which is a course on
                  Python. Here, I assisted a class of over 500 students on
                  learning essential Python concepts, helping them fix errors in
                  their code and thus get better grades on their assignments. I
                  also held office hours and helped with grading during labs.
                  This role really helped with improving my communication and
                  collaboration skills.
